# Character AI Unofficial Node API

> Node.js client for the unofficial [Character AI API](https://character.ai/), an awesome website which brings characters to life with AI!

## Intro

This repository is inspired by [RichardDorian's unofficial node API](https://github.com/RichardDorian/node-character.ai/).
Though, I found it hard to use and it was not really stable and archived. So I remade it in javascript.

**This project is not affiliated with Character AI in any way! It is a community project.**
The purpose of this project is to bring and build projects powered by Character AI.

If you like this project, please check their [website](https://character.ai/).

## Features

* 👍 Fully written in Javascript and CommonJS (for max compatibility and ease of use)
* ⌚ Asynchronous requests
* 🗣️ Use conversations or use the API to fetch information
* 🧸 Easy to use
* 🔁 Active development
* 👤 Guest & token login support

## Installation

```bash
npm install node_characterai
```

## Usage

Basic guest login and conversation message:
```js
const CharacterAI = require('node_characterai');
const characterAI = new CharacterAI();

(async() => {
    await characterAI.authenticateAsGuest();

    const characterId = "8_1NyR8w1dOXmI1uWaieQcd147hecbdIK7CeEAIrdJw" // Discord moderator

    const chat = await characterAI.createOrContinueChat(characterId);
    const response = await chat.sendAndAwaitResponse('Hello discord mod!', true)

    console.log(response);
    // use response.text to use it in a string.
})();
```

#### ⚠️ WARNING: This part is currently under construction and is not available to the latest build (1.1.3). If you wish to use it, use the files of the code source directly. otherwise just skip this part.

Interacting with images:

🖼️ Character AI has the ability to generate and interpret images in a conversation. Some characters base this concept into special characters, or maybe use it for recognizing images, or to interact with a character and give it more details on something: *the possibilities are endless*.

💁 Most of the Character AI image features can be used like so:

```js
// Most of these functions will return you an URL.

await chat.generateImage("dolphins swimming in green water")

// You can upload images from links, to a file path to a buffer and so on.
await chat.uploadImage("https://www.example.com/image.jpg")
await chat.uploadImage(path.join(__dirname, './cat.jpg'))

await chat.sendAndAwaitResponse({text: "What is in this image?", image_rel_path: ${imageUrl}}, true)
// Including the image relative path is necessary to upload an image.
```
*Props to @creepycats for the base implementation of image features*

## Using an Access Token

Some parts of the API, like managing a conversation requires for you to be logged in using an `accessToken`.
To get it, you can open your browser, go to the [character.ai website](https://character.ai) in `localStorage`.

To do so:
1. Open the Character AI website in your browser
2. Open the developer tools `F12` and go to the `Application` tab.
3. Go to the `Storage` section and click on `Local Storage`.
4. Look for the `@@auth0spajs@@::dyD3gE281MqgISG7FuIXYhL2WEknqZzv::https://auth0.character.ai/::openid profile email offline_access` key.
5. Open the body and copy the access token.

When using the package, you can:
* Login as guest using `authenticateAsGuest()` - *for mass usage or testing purposes*
* Login with your account or a token using `authenticateWithToken()`

## Finding the Character ID

You can find your character ID in the URL of a Character's chat page.
For example, if you go to the chat page of the character `Test Character` you will see the URL `https://character.ai/chat/chat?char=5f7f9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b`.

The last part of the URL is the character ID:

## Troubleshooting

|**Problem**|Answer|
|-------|------|
|❌ **Token was invalid**|Make sure your token is actually valid and you copied your entire token (its pretty long).|
|❓ **Fetch is not defined**|Upgrade to node 18 or higher (19 is better) or try installing `node-fetch`.|
|👥 **`authenticateAsGuest()` doesn't work**|See issue [#14](https://github.com/realcoloride/node_characterai/issues/14).|
|🦒 **Hit the max amount of messages?**|Sadly, guest accounts only have a limited amount of messages before they get limited and forced to login. See below for more info 👇|
|🪐 **How to use an account to mass use the library?**|You can use **conversations**, a feature introduced in `1.0.0`, to assign to users and channels. **To reproduce a conversation, use OOC (out of character) to make the AI think you're with multiple people.** __See an example here:__ ![chrome_RDbmXXtFNl](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108619637/224778145-284dd89e-7960-499c-b0f0-0deca419c578.png)![chrome_BgF8crPvqC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108619637/224778153-c2a42a26-c5f7-4148-9644-34353482833e.png) (Disclaimer: on some characters, their personality will make them ignore any OOC request).|
|😮 **Why is a chrome window opening?**|This is because as of currently, the simple fetching is broken and I use puppeteer (a chromium browser control library) to go around cloudflare's restrictions.|
|📣 **Is this official?**|No, this project is made by a fan of the website and is unofficial. *To support the developers, please check out [their website](https://beta.character.ai)*.|
